Python Figure Reference: scatter Traces
A plotly.graph_objects.Scatter trace is a graph object in the figure's data list with any of the named arguments or attributes listed below.

The scatter trace type encompasses line charts, scatter charts, text charts, and bubble charts. The data visualized as scatter point or lines is set in `x` and `y`. Text (appearing either on the chart or on hover only) is via `text`. Bubble charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to numerical arrays.

name
Code: fig.update_traces(name=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: string
Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the legend item and on hover.

visible
Code: fig.update_traces(visible=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: enumerated , one of ( True | False | "legendonly" )
Default: True
Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

showlegend
Code: fig.update_traces(showlegend=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: boolean
Default: True
Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend.

legend
Code: fig.update_traces(legend=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: subplotid
Default: legend
Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in. References to these legends are "legend", "legend2", "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`, etc.

legendrank
Code: fig.update_traces(legendrank=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: number
Default: 1000
Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. When having unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed after traces i.e. according to their order in data and layout.

legendgroup

When showing info for several points, "xother" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: True`) are available. Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.

And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, "2016-10-13 09:15:23.456" with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display "09~15~23.46"By default the values are formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.

yhoverformat
Code: fig.update_traces(yhoverformat=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: string
Default: ""
Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y` using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, "2016-10-13 09:15:23.456" with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display "09~15~23.46"By default the values are formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.

meta
Code: fig.update_traces(meta=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: number or categorical coordinate string
Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text` `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.

customdata
Code: fig.update_traces(customdata=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: list, numpy array, or Pandas series of numbers, strings, or datetimes.
Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

xaxis
Code: fig.update_traces(xaxis=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: subplotid
Default: x
Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

yaxis
Code: fig.update_traces(yaxis=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: subplotid
Default: y
Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.

orientation
Code: fig.update_traces(orientation=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: enumerated , one of ( "v" | "h" )
Only relevant in the following cases: 1. when `scattermode` is set to "group". 2. when `stackgroup` is used, and only the first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not if it is `False`. Sets the stacking direction. With "v" ("h"), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added. Also affects the default value of `fill`.

groupnorm
Code: fig.update_traces(groupnorm=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: enumerated , one of ( "" | "fraction" | "percent" )
Default: ""
Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not if it is `False`. Sets the normalization for the sum of this `stackgroup`. With "fraction", the value of each trace at each location is divided by the sum of all trace values at that location. "percent" is the same but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.

alignmentgroup
Code: fig.update_traces(alignmentgroup=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))

Type: string
Default: ""
Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or their x values if `orientation` is "h"). If blank or omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also turns `fill` on by default, using "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "h" ("v") and sets the default `mode` to "lines" irrespective of point count. You can only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to) other traces in the same group. With multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.

Code: fig.update_traces(marker_autocolorscale=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: boolean
Default: True
Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (`autocolorscale: True`) or the palette determined by `marker.colorscale`. Has an effect only if in `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or `autocolorscale` is True, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the `color` array are all positive, all negative or mixed.

References to these shared color axes are "coloraxis", "coloraxis2", "coloraxis3", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`, `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis.

colorbar
Code: fig.update_traces(marker_colorbar=dict(...), selector=dict(type='scatter'))

dtick
Code: fig.update_traces(marker_colorbar_dtick=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: number or categorical coordinate string
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to "log" and "date" axes. If the axis `type` is "log", then ticks are set every 10^(n"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. "log" has several special values; "L<f>", where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = "L0.5" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use "D1" (all digits) or "D2" (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for "D1" and "D2". If the axis `type` is "date", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. "date" also has special values "M<n>" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to "2000-01-15" and `dtick` to "M3". To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to "M48"

exponentformat

Type: enumerated , one of ( "none" | "e" | "E" | "power" | "SI" | "B" )
Default: "B"
Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If "none", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If "e", 1e+9. If "E", 1E+9. If "power", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If "SI", 1G. If "B", 1B.

labelalias
Code: fig.update_traces(marker_colorbar_labelalias=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: number or categorical coordinate string
Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For example using {US: 'USA', CA: 'Canada'} changes US to USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown must match the keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1 instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired) can include html-like tags or MathJax.

len
Code: fig.update_traces(marker_colorbar_len=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))

Code: fig.update_traces(marker_colorbar_lenmode=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: enumerated , one of ( "fraction" | "pixels" )
Default: "fraction"
Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot "fraction" or in "pixels. Use `len` to set the value.

Type: enumerated , one of ( "none" | "tozeroy" | "tozerox" | "tonexty" | "tonextx" | "toself" | "tonext" )
Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy" fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the space between two traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext" should not be used if one trace does not enclose the other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to) other traces in the same group. With multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.

Sets a fill gradient. If not specified, the fillcolor is used instead.

colorscale
Code: fig.update_traces(fillgradient_colorscale=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: colorscale
Sets the fill gradient colors as a color scale. The color scale is interpreted as a gradient applied in the direction specified by "orientation", from the lowest to the highest value of the scatter plot along that axis, or from the center to the most distant point from it, if orientation is "radial".

start
Code: fig.update_traces(fillgradient_start=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: number
Sets the gradient start value. It is given as the absolute position on the axis determined by the orientiation. E.g., if orientation is "horizontal", the gradient will be horizontal and start from the x-position given by start. If omitted, the gradient starts at the lowest value of the trace along the respective axis. Ignored if orientation is "radial".

stop
Code: fig.update_traces(fillgradient_stop=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: number
Sets the gradient end value. It is given as the absolute position on the axis determined by the orientiation. E.g., if orientation is "horizontal", the gradient will be horizontal and end at the x-position given by end. If omitted, the gradient ends at the highest value of the trace along the respective axis. Ignored if orientation is "radial".

type
Code: fig.update_traces(fillgradient_type=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: enumerated , one of ( "radial" | "horizontal" | "vertical" | "none" )
Default: "none"
Sets the type/orientation of the color gradient for the fill. Defaults to "none".

fillpattern
Code: fig.update_traces(fillpattern=dict(...), selector=dict(type='scatter'))

Sets the pattern within the marker.

bgcolor
Code: fig.update_traces(fillpattern_bgcolor=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: color or array of colors
When there is no colorscale sets the color of background pattern fill. Defaults to a `marker.color` background when `fillmode` is "overlay". Otherwise, defaults to a transparent background.

fgcolor
Code: fig.update_traces(fillpattern_fgcolor=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: color or array of colors
When there is no colorscale sets the color of foreground pattern fill. Defaults to a `marker.color` background when `fillmode` is "replace". Otherwise, defaults to dark grey or white to increase contrast with the `bgcolor`.

fgopacity
Code: fig.update_traces(fillpattern_fgopacity=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: number between or equal to 0 and 1
Sets the opacity of the foreground pattern fill. Defaults to a 0.5 when `fillmode` is "overlay". Otherwise, defaults to 1.

size
Code: fig.update_traces(fillpattern_size=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: number or array of numbers greater than or equal to 0
Default: 8
Sets the size of unit squares of the pattern fill in pixels, which corresponds to the interval of repetition of the pattern.

solidity
Code: fig.update_traces(fillpattern_solidity=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: number or array of numbers between or equal to 0 and 1
Default: 0.3
Sets the solidity of the pattern fill. Solidity is roughly the fraction of the area filled by the pattern. Solidity of 0 shows only the background color without pattern and solidty of 1 shows only the foreground color without pattern.

hoverlabel
Code: fig.update_traces(hoverlabel=dict(...), selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: dict containing one or more of the keys listed below.
align

Type: integer or array of integers greater than or equal to -1
Default: 15
Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer >3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to `namelength - 3` characters and add an ellipsis.

hoveron
Code: fig.update_traces(hoveron=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: flaglist string. Any combination of "points", "fills" joined with a "+"
Examples: "points", "fills", "points+fills"
Do the hover effects highlight individual points (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled regions? If the fill is "toself" or "tonext" and there are no markers or text, then the default is "fills", otherwise it is "points".

stackgaps
Code: fig.update_traces(stackgaps=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: enumerated , one of ( "infer zero" | "interpolate" )
Default: "infer zero"
Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not if it is `False`. Determines how we handle locations at which other traces in this group have data but this one does not. With "infer zero" we insert a zero at these locations. With "interpolate" we linearly interpolate between existing values, and extrapolate a constant beyond the existing values.

xcalendar
Code: fig.update_traces(xcalendar=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: enumerated , one of ( "chinese" | "coptic" | "discworld" | "ethiopian" | "gregorian" | "hebrew" | "islamic" | "jalali" | "julian" | "mayan" | "nanakshahi" | "nepali" | "persian" | "taiwan" | "thai" | "ummalqura" )

Default: "gregorian"
Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.

uirevision
Code: fig.update_traces(uirevision=<VALUE>, selector=dict(type='scatter'))
Type: number or categorical coordinate string
Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: True` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: True}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
